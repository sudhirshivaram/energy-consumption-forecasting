# Energy Consumption ML Project: Implementation Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan for advancing the Energy Consumption ML project beyond the LinearRegression baseline. It is designed for practical, interview-ready reference.

---

## 1. Objective
- Predict building heating load using the UCI Energy Efficiency dataset.
- Build on a strong LinearRegression baseline to explore advanced models, feature engineering, and robust evaluation.

---

## 2. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Baseline Review
- Confirm LinearRegression baseline metrics and feature importances.
- Ensure code, config, and artifacts are reproducible.

### Step 2: Regularized Linear Models
- Update `config/config.yaml` to use `Ridge` and `Lasso` (one at a time).
- Tune `alpha` parameter (try 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100).
- Retrain and compare metrics and feature importances to baseline.
- Document any changes in coefficient stability or feature selection.

### Step 3: Multicollinearity & Feature Importance Analysis
- Visualize feature correlation matrix (heatmap).
- Retrain models without `cooling_load` to assess its impact.
- Analyze how feature importances shift.

### Step 4: Tree-Based Models
- Update config to use RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost (one at a time).
- Use default hyperparameters, then basic tuning (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`).
- Compare train/test metrics and check for overfitting.
- Check for negative predictions and document handling.

### Step 5: Feature Engineering
- Add interaction terms (e.g., `glazing_area * orientation`).
- Try polynomial features (e.g., `surface_area^2`).
- Create ratios (e.g., `glazing_area / surface_area`).
- Remove or add features to test their impact.
- Retrain and evaluate after each change.

### Step 6: Model Interpretability & Error Analysis
- For linear models: Examine coefficients and their physical meaning.
- For tree models: Use feature importances and SHAP values.
- Plot residuals vs predicted values, analyze outliers.
- Visualize predictions vs actuals.

### Step 7: Robustness & Productionization
- After each model, check for negative predictions and apply post-processing if needed.
- Ensure all steps are reproducible and config-driven.
- Save model, scaler, and config with each artifact.
- Plan for input validation and monitoring (future work).

---

## 3. Best Practices
- Use a single, updatable config file for all experiments.
- Save a copy of the config with model outputs for traceability.
- Document all findings and changes after each experiment.
- Avoid over-engineering; focus on clear, incremental improvements.

---

## 4. Success Criteria
- Improved or comparable R², RMSE, MAE, and MAPE on test set.
- Stable and interpretable feature importances.
- No overfitting (minimal train/test gap).
- No negative predictions (or handled appropriately).
- All code and results are reproducible.
